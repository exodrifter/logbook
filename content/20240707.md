# critical hardware failure five days before delta h con

my only laptop, which i was going to use to demo the game, has developed a critical hardware failure this weekend that causes the system to malfunction, freeze, and crash. i've determined that the problem is likely either a malfunctioning cpu or motherboard, and i cannot get replacement parts in time for the event
