I'm **exodrifter** (she/her), a Cambodian American indie game developer, vtuber, functional programmer, and musician based in Austin, Texas. I love yuri, space, and heavy board games. Making games that connect with people in emotional and meaningful ways is my passion.

</div>

I'm currently working as an indie game developer making games in Godot, much of it live on Twitch. In the past, I've worked in the logistics industry as a Haskell developer and in the dataviz and archviz industry as a Unity VR developer. In college, I was the President of the student-run game development club Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS) at The University of Texas at Austin during the school year of 2013-2014.

Opportunities to work on video games and functional software interest me. If you want someone like me on your team, I'm open to it. [See resume...](resume.md)
