Hey everyone! I'm going to start making a series of update videos on Access development. They'll be super casual, I won't plan for them at all, and I'll say "um" and "uh" a lot while being insecure about the pitch of my voice.

Hopefully videos will be easier to make and I'll be able to make these more often than text posts, which seems kind of counter-intuitive. If it makes any sense, I feel like text posts take much more work to reach the minimum level of quality needed to be comprehend-able than it does with video.

Anyway, thanks so much for being my patron! Hopefully this will be a fun and entertaining way to share updates with y'all~ o w o
