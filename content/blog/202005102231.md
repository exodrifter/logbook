It's really hard to not say "um" while you're recording something. I hope you enjoy this awkward update!

Trying out Vimeo's service for the videos now, since it actually has an integration with Patreon that allows the videos to only be available to patrons. If you have the unlisted link from previous videos, anyone could technically watch the video.

If this experiment goes well, I'll be using Vimeo from now on, and I may update all of the old videos to use Vimeo. See you all around next time!
