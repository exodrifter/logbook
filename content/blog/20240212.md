Welcome to devlog 8 of _lost contact_, a narrative-driven, hidden object game about loneliness.

This week, much of the station was blocked out with basic furnishings. In particular, however, the server room got some special treatment. The server racks are randomly generated every time the game is run. And, thanks to the approach we've taken, randomizing the colors of things like wires and buttons was pretty straightforward.

We're definitely in the content generation part of the game development process now. There isn't much to say, so I'll just run a reel of all the new rooms:

- Server
- Storage
- Bedroom
- Meeting
- Office
- Medbay
- Workshop

In particular, the medbay and mechanical workshop rooms are missing a lot of assets. Tanuki is working on making those right now, in addition to the assets needed for all of the laboratory rooms. Next week, I'm planning on implementing the inventory system and building out more of the levels

I'm still streaming development of this game four days a week [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_) if you'd like to come by to see how it's doing. And, if you're a patron, thanks for your support once again. If you aren't a patron, I hope you'll consider joining [my Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/arqFQVt). I'll see you in the next devlog!
