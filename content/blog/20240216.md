# nerves

i always get nervous when preparing for something important, even if i am excited, confident, and looking forward to it. unfortunately, sometimes my body likes to decide that anxiety is the right way to react to these kinds of situations. by, you know, making it harder to breathe.

oh no ðŸ’¦
