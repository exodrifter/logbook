# Subject note

A [note-taking-strategy](note-taking-strategy.md) where each note is mutable but contains citations to immutable notes such as [Zettelkasten Notes](zettelkasten-note.md) showing how that understanding was developed. ([202305280429](../entries/202305280429.md), [202305290628](../entries/202305290628.md), [20240919041428](../entries/20240919041428.md))

Originally, I used [Mutable notes](mutable-note.md) to fulfill the role of summarizing information, but I disliked not having a way to check how I came to an understanding. ([202305290637](../entries/202305290637.md))
