# Development Journal

This [note-taking strategy](note-taking-strategy.md) was abandoned in favor of the [Journal](journal.md) strategy, which is more general as it doesn't require a focus in troubleshooting. ([202305281748](../entries/202305281748.md))

Originally, the development journal was a daily note which was appended to along with timestamps in order to describe a work session or a workday. These were eventually migrated to the [Zettelkasten Note](zettelkasten-note.md) format. ([202305280429](../entries/202305280429.md), [20240724200049](../entries/20240724200049.md))

Each journal was structured with a summary of what I took note of that day followed by timestamped headings for each note. Appending to the journal with timestamps was made easier with the Template plugin in Obsidian. ([202306011947](../entries/202306011947.md), [202306020014](../entries/202306020014.md))
