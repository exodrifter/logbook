# Decals disappear near edges

The edge of a decal can sometimes disappear when viewed from certain angles in Godot 4.2.2. This may be due to a bug in Godot, tracked by the following issues:

- [godot/godotengine#81889](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/81889)
- [godot/godotengine#73945](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/73945)

A workaround for this issue is to add more padding to the decal texture.
