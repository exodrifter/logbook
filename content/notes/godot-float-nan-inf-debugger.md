# Float values NaN and INF are displayed as 0 in debugger and inspector

As of Godot 4.2.2, `float` values `NaN` and `INF` are displayed as 0 in the debugger and inspector.

See: [godotengine/godot#88006](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/88006)

I consider this issue to be a [Godot crime](godot-crimes.md).
