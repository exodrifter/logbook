# `is_polygon_clockwise` returns the opposite result

In Godot 4.2.2, the implementation of [`is_polygon_clockwise`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/classes/class_geometry2d.html#class-geometry2d-method-is-polygon-clockwise) in `Geometry2D` treats the vertices as being in a space where the y-axis is positive in the up direction. This causes it to return the incorrect value for 2D games, since Godot treats the y-axis as being positive in the down direction.

I opened [godotengine/godot#89635](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89635) to address this issue in the API.

I consider this issue to be a [Godot crime](godot-crimes.md).
