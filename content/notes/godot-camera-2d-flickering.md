# My `Camera2D` is flickering

> My camera is rendering the incorrect position for a frame even though I've put in a debugging statement showing that the position is correct!

`Camera2D` contains a mutable state which needs to be communicated to a `Viewport` in the rendering server. This problem can be fixed by calling `align()` to force the state in the rendering server to be synced.
