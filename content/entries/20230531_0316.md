I tried adding navigation to the NPC characters in null using `NavigationAgent2D` and ran into a weird problem where `_physics_process(_delta)` was never being called whenever I had a value for `target_position` that I wanted to use. As it turns out, I forgot to use `call_deferred("actor_setup")` when waiting one physics frame in `_ready()`.

Not sure why awaiting in `_ready()` causes this problem. It might be worthwhile looking into that later.
