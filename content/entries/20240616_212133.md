While working on Ultraprocessor Ribbon, some team members couldn't load `.blend` files and others could despite everyone having set the `filesystem/import/blender/blender3_path` editor setting. This caused Godot 4.2.2 to complain that the blender scene and any scenes containing blender scenes were invalid or corrupt.

As it turns out, when you set this property using Godot's file manager and you select the blender executable, Godot automatically sets the path to the folder containing the executable. For example, if Blender is installed at `/bin/blender`, Godot will set the path to `/bin`.

However, some on the DemureSoft team had typed the path directly into the text field, setting it to the path including the name of the executable. On other words, they entered the value `/bin/blender` for the `filesystem/import/blender/blender3_path` setting. The import issues were resolved after changing the value to `/bin` and reloading the project.
