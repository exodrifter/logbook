I decided to not stream today so I could focus more on being introspective and being in touch with my emotions while writing dialog for the game. I think this will help me write better dialog for _no signal_.

I want to draw on my experiences of being lonely for the game -- in particular my frequent frustration with finding a romantic partner -- for Spirit. I talked to Tanuki about this and we both agree that the game should be about where Spirit's inability to find a romantic partner comes from and that there isn't a definitive answer for that.

Tanuki suggested a few prompts that Spirit might ask themselves internally, which I think will be useful to keep in mind while writing dialog:
- Why am I having a hard time connecting with these people?
- Do I like these people?
- Do I worry these people are only temporary?
- Do I feel these people understand me?
- Do these people like me?
- What is putting a barrier between me and others?
- Why do I find it hard to love?
- What _is_ love?
