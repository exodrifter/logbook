Ran into an interesting issue while working on _no signal_ (see [20240725192146](20240725192146.md)) with `TextureButton` where the click mask didn't appear to scale to fill the entire button even though the `stretch_mode` was set to `STRETCH_SCALE`.

I ended up fixing the problem by creating a new click mask which matched the size of the `TextureButton` in the UI.
