Trying to set up a new cabal project with relude, but it doesn't work for some reason:

```
exodrifter@rain ~/w/e/catbox> cabal run

[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: base, catbox)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: base, catbox
```

I'm confused, because I would expect cabal to download whatever the right version of a library is for the build. However, after some research, that's apparently not how it works for `base`.

> Your version of the `base` library is `4.15.0.0`. `base` is special in the sense that its version is [tied to your GHC version](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/libraries/version-history), which seems to be GHC 9.0.1.

So, unlike with other libraries, cabal can't simply install a previous version of `base` when it's required by the `build-depends:` of some package. So, in order for the compilation to work i need to downgrade the version of ghc installed on my system. I manage my ghc installation with `ghcup`, so I can pick a different ghc version with `ghcup tui`.
