After some investigation and assistance from `crazy_stewie`, we managed to determine the cause of the issue.

First, we disabled the render server using `RenderingServer.render_loop_enabled = false` when we started the transition and drew the next frame using `RenderingServer.force_draw.call_deferred()`. This helped us confirm that the frame was being rendered incorrectly for the next frame, sometime between the transition starting and when the camera position was set.

Adding a breakpoint, we were also able to confirm that the camera position was set correctly during that frame as well, but it was still rendering in the incorrect position.

We also used the following code to see when the frames were drawn:
```gdscript
func init()
	RenderingServer.frame_pre_draw.connect(frame_pre_draw)
	RenderingServer.frame_post_draw.connect(frame_post_draw)

func frame_pre_draw():
	print("Pre Draw")

func frame_post_draw():
	print("Post Draw")
```

This, coupled with other debugging prints helped point out the fact that there was a frame being rendered with the position set to the correct value, but still rendering in the incorrect place.

As it turns out, as `crazy_stewie` explained, the camera can be thought of as having two different representations; the camera is just a fancy interface to a viewport in the `RenderingServer`, which does the actual rendering. The function to force the camera to use the new position is `align()`. Calling this function after setting the position fixes the issue.

Inspecting the code, it appears that `align()` takes the global position into account when updating its internal representation before calling `update_scroll()` which updates the viewport. Adding a debugging print for the `update_scroll` function also reveals that it is called before the frame is rendered, but since it doesn't take the global position into account, the viewport is not updated correctly.

Calling `align()` fixes the problem. Consider the following code:
```gdscript
func update_position():
	if target:
		global_position = target.global_position + Vector2(0, -100)
		print("Setting camera position to ", global_position)
		print("Smoothing enabled? ", position_smoothing_enabled, "; Target position: ", get_target_position())
		align()
		print("Smoothing enabled? ", position_smoothing_enabled, "; Target position: ", get_target_position())

func _init():
	RenderingServer.frame_pre_draw.connect(frame_pre_draw)
	RenderingServer.frame_post_draw.connect(frame_post_draw)

func frame_pre_draw():
	print("Pre Draw")

func frame_post_draw():
	print("Post Draw")

func _notification(what: int):
	# This notification will call `update_scroll()`. No other notification calls `align()`
	# See https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/a8453cb3337c2e27c061a385f9c772cf670e38e0/scene/2d/camera_2d.cpp#L230-L234
	if what == NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED:
		print("update_scroll")
```

This results in the following (abridged) log:
```
Setting camera position to (-120, -73)
Smoothing enabled? false; Target position: (136, -49)
Smoothing enabled? false; Target position: (-120, -73)
update_scroll
Pre Draw
Post Draw
```

As you can see, the target position isn't updated unless we call `align` even though we set the position and `update_scroll`, which updates the viewport in the `RenderingServer`, will use the incorrect position (the target position) if we don't call align.
