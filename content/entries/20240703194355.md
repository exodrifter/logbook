I was migrating Godot crimes from my private notes to my public logbook, when I remembered that [202402222021](202402222021.md) has been fixed.

To explain the issue a bit more, since my last note about the issue was a bit lacking, I was running into a problem where:
- I had a scene which inherited another
- That scene exported a `Dictionary` variable
- Among all instances of that scene, that variable would have the same `Dictionary` reference

I provided an MRP of the issue to adamscott, who fixed it in [godotengine/godot#88741](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88741). The fix is slated to be included in Godot 4.3.
