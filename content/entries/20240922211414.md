At San Japan, a friend told me about the Draknek New Voices Puzzle Grant, which seems like a particularly good fit for _no signal_:

> [grants.draknek.org](https://grants.draknek.org/)
>
> The Draknek New Voices Puzzle Grant is a grant opportunity for game developers from traditionally underrepresented groups and backgrounds who are interested in designing and developing puzzle games.
>
> \[...\]
>
> **What are we looking for?**
> Our selection process focuses on puzzle games under active development, with a playable prototype, from early-career or under-the-radar developers who identify with an under-represented group within the games industry.
>
> **What is the grant offering?**
> The Draknek New Voices Puzzle Grant is offering 6 grants of $15,000 USD each. We are also offering opportunities for mentorship through 2025, as well as a supportive community of industry experts to provide advice and feedback.

The application deadline is 23:59 PST 7th October 2024 and the decisions will be made by 16th December 2024. I just finished submitting _no signal_ to it.
