I made 18 decals for _no signal_ but I didn't want to export all of them manually. So, I tried to figure out how to export krita images in bulk. According to `krita --help`, there is an `--export` and a `--export-filename` flag that I would expect to work. I figure out how to use these flags:

```sh
krita 1a.kra --export --export-filename 1a.png
```

However, Krita just exports an empty image. According to the Krita documentation, the `--export` flag _should_ work for this:

> This is primarily used in bash or shell scripts, for example, to mass convert KRA files into PNGs.

Through internet searches, I find out that you can also export the PNG by treating the Krita file as a zip. I found a Krita mass export repository treating the Krita file as a zip archive, which says that the file is named `mergedimage.png` and that it is in the first directory level:

> [voidcase/krita_exporter](https://github.com/voidcase/krita_exporter/blob/master/krita_exporter.py#L56)

> ```py
> def export_kra(src: T.Union[str, Path], dst: T.Union[str, Path]):
>     with ZipFile(src) as src_zip:
>         src_zip.extract('mergedimage.png', '/tmp/')
>         Path('/tmp/mergedimage.png').rename(dst)
> ```

I don't want to figure out how to run this repository, so I look for a way to extract a specific file from a zip instead:

This gives me the following command, which works!

```sh
unzip -p 1a.kra mergedimage.png >1a.png
```
