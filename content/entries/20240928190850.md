**Catbox** is an idea I had last night while thinking about creating a better static site generator.

The idea is to create a general-purpose visual scripting tool for transforming input files into some output format.

For a static site generator application, for example, you could take in a directory of markdown files and convert them to html:

```toml
in = [ { name = "arg1", type = "text" } ]
out = [ { name = "result", from = "node2", index = "html" } ]

[[nodes]]
name = "node1"
type = "gfm"
in = [ { from = "in", index = "arg1" } ]

[[nodes]]
name = "node2"
type = "md_to_html"
in = [ { from = "node1", index = "md" } ]
```

The graphs defined by catbox should always be pure (no `IO` operations are allowed, for example).

To run the code contained within the graph, we would like to invoke it on the command line like this:

```
catbox graph.toml output/ --arg1=path/to/dir/
```
