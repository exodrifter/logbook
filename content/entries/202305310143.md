I want to make NPCs move around in null, so I'm going to try following Godot's [2D navigation tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.html).

The overview at the beginning of the tutorial makes it sound like we'll need to learn how to use:
* `Astar2D` - So the agents can move between predefined points.
* `NavigationAgent2D` - So the agents can avoid each other.

The 2D navigation mesh should be generated by the Tilemap, so I don't think we'll need to look into that.
