Was trying yesterday to somehow combine what I've learned from making a cover of Porter Robinson's _something comforting_ and the drum and bass skills I've been practicing. I wrote the following lyrics:

> imagination is cheap to you
> if only you could see this too
> you say that ideas are what you do
> if only i could see that too
>
> in the gardens you can grow
> someplace you can take it slow
> and some neighbors that say hello
> a place you don't play solo

Unfortunately, I was unable to transition into a neurofunk break that felt right. While I was streaming, `Booooooooooooooooooom` suggested I listen to _La Roux - In For The Kill (Subsonik DnB Remix)_.
