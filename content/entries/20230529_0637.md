I used to make new notes and update them whenever I felt like it, an unstructured approach I will call Mutable note. However, the one problem with this approach I have always disliked is that my old understanding of something is not very visible.

I dislike how the old understanding is essentially invisible because:

* I have found myself realizing that my current understanding is incorrect, and I may not remember what I was thinking when I wrote the note so I essentially have to start over from scratch
* The old note might have had the correct understanding, but if I've mutated the note in place or deleted the old note, then I no longer have that information and I have to develop it from scratch again.

There are potential solutions to this problem, such as using a version tracker like `git`. However, I don't like this solution because the history is still invisible in an ordinary note-taking app and I'd have to use the command line to see the history. Also, since I want to take Zettelkasten Notes that can be composed freely in any way I wish to form different Subject Notes, the history for an idea might not be as simple as looking at the history for a single file. Instead, multiple notes may share a single source as history.
