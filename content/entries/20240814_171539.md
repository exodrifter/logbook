Notes from today's music lesson:

There are three different general types of drum patterns:
- **Standard time:** Kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on beats 2 and 4
- **Half time:** Kick on beat 1, snare on beat 3
- **Double time:** Kick on every beat with a snare on each half beat

The exact timing of the kick and snare doesn't matter; these types describe the general _amount of kicks and snares_ in the pattern, and not necessarily the timing or whatever else might be layered on top of it (like hats).

In a drum set, you will generally have a low, mid, and a high frequency element.

**Ghost notes** are softer/quieter notes that aren't the main focus. This usually only applies to things like kicks or snares, which normally draw a lost of the listener's focus.

You don't normally call softer hat notes to be ghost notes since hats tend to be treated as being in the background. However, you might call louder hat hits **accented hits**.

Hats can do closed hits, open hits, and _sloshes_. **Slosh hits** are when the pedal for opening/closing the high hat is held in-between, creating a small gap between the two hats.
