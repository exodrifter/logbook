no signal stream 106:
- There's an unlabeled drive in the storage room, but as it turns out the drive isn't unlabeled; it's just so bright that the lighting makes it seem like the label is completely white.
- Tanuki added the cupola scene!
- There's a shader built-in that you can use called `FRONT_FACING` to check if a face is a backface or not. ([20240802_190401](20240802_190401.md))

docket:
- [x] Implement nicer click UI for card code
- [x] ~~Add an animation which verifies that the card is in a valid state.~~ We dynamically create the UI elements, so setting up an animation player sounds quite difficult. Instead, I added a visual indication that the sequence is correct as well as a sound effect that plays when the sequence is correct.
- [ ] Limit the camera to the bounds of the level
- [ ] Add a button to see all of the camera controls
- [ ] Add a button to reset the camera
- [ ] ~~Add sounds for when chats are downloaded.~~ Tried implementing a sound for the download bar filling in, but none of them sound right, probably because most operating systems and programs never do this.
- [x] Add sound for when radar detects no items left
- [x] Arm screen has the wrong proportions
- [ ] Add a button to turn on the beacon circuit, so that it matches what you have to do in the reactor room
- [x] Make sure that clicking on the screen retains focus in the card writer screen
- [ ] ~~Make the back faces of geometry black~~ I didn't like this when implemented, because it caused z-fighting issues with geometry placed directly ontop of a surface and it made it easy to get lost moving the camera if it happened to clip into geometry as the screen could suddenly turn black.
- [x] Unmount doesn't say what drive you are unmounting
- [x] A drive in the storage room is unlabeled
- [x] Say "other columns in sequence a" in yuri dialog
- [x] Add a hint about how the digits are added in the 7 note
- [x] Add a note that the checksum also includes the index number
- [x] Fix grammatical mistakes in copy (we will all be -> we'll all be, for stm send a -> for stm to send a, you're going to find ourselves -> you're going to find yourselves)
