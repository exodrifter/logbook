I'm trying to debug why avoidance doesn't seem to work with Godot's [2D navigation tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.html) example code.

`ChotoTheBright` tried to recreate the example in 3D as close as he could in short order and noticed that the agents did avoid each other, but their target was a moving player in the game.

He suggested that I try moving the target every frame, but that seems like a relatively high cost test for me to do right now. I'm going to familiarize myself with what the script is doing first and read the documentation for `NavigationAgent2D`.
