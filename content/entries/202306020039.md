[202305300005](202305300005.md) is actually incorrect.

In fact, Obsidian _does_ change the link display text if the display text is the same as the name of the file in the path and there is no corresponding alias for the file.

For example:
* Create an internal link `[[Foobar|Foobar]]`
* Create the file `Foobar`
* Rename `Foobar` to `bar-baz`
* Observe that the internal link has been updated to `[[bar-baz|bar-baz]]`

This problem can be avoided by adding the display text used in the internal link to the file as an alias for the file **before** renaming the file. In the previous example, this would be done by adding the alias `Foobar` before the file is renamed to `bar-baz`.
