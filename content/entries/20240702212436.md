stream 99 of _no signal_:
- Started work on adding drive encryption back to the game
- Refactored the way item collections are done in the inventory
- Made it possible to select which collection you want to mount a drive from
- Ran into an issue in Godot where `reduce` drops type information (It always returns `Array`)
