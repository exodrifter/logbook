Music lesson, talking about DnB drum patterns:
- DnB snares are usually high pitched and clean/tight (short release)
- Breakbeats usually have the snare on 2 and 4 and a ghost note right before the bar line (last 32nd at 90 BPM)
- Breakbeats don't usually have toms, so they end up using a lot of snare fills
- Rides add the hissing sound that is present in a lot of DnB and breakbeats
- A breakbeat is a type of groove.
- Are toms used for anything other than drum fills? They are in Bossa Nova and Latin music, which use toms to accentuate different parts of the pattern.
