While trying to follow the [nix.dev tutorial](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/ad-hoc-shell-environments), I found that the `nix-shell -p cowsay lolcat` command didn't work.

I am running Arch Linux and had installed Nix by running `sudo pacman -S nix`.

The first problem was that I had not completed the Nix installation, resulting in Nix being unable to find `nixpkgs`. This wasn't mentioned in the tutorial and it appears to be a quirk of how `nix` is packaged for Arch Linux. This was fixed by adding a channel:

```sh
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
nix-channel --update
```

Next, I found that after running `nix-shell -p cowsay lolcat`, that neither `cowsay` nor `lolcat` could be found by my fish shell. This is apparently because the way I start `fish` causes the `PATH` variable, which Nix modifies to be clobbered. I apparently had this line at the end of my `.bashrc` file:

```sh
exec fish
```

I'm not entirely sure how this clobbers the `PATH` as the `exec` documentation is pretty sparse, with `man exec` stating:

```
EXEC(1)                              fish-shell                              EXEC(1)

NAME
       exec - execute command in current process

SYNOPSIS
       exec COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       exec  replaces  the currently running shell with a new command. On successful
       completion, exec never returns. exec cannot be used inside a pipeline.

       The --help or -h option displays help about using this command.

EXAMPLE
       exec emacs starts up the emacs text editor, and exits fish. When emacs exits,
       the session will terminate.

```

I gave up on trying to figure out how to get `exec` to stop clobbering the `PATH` variable. So, I decided to remove the `exec fish` line and configured my terminal emulator `alacritty` to launch `fish` on start instead.
