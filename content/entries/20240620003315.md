Yesterday, I changed the save game code to use the `var_to_str` and `str_to_var` functions to save and load the save ([20240617214349](20240617214349.md)). I did this over JSON because in Godot, `JSON` does not round trip.

Unfortunately, this opens the possibility to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities, as this will allow a malicious user to insert a script which gets run when the save is loaded.

Looking into what options I have, I found that `store_var` and `get_var` let you read and write `Variants` while preventing scripts from running. In the documentation, it states:

> [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/classes/class_fileaccess.html#class-fileaccess-method-store-var)
>
> Stores any Variant value in the file. If `full_objects` is `true`, encoding objects is allowed (and can potentially include code).

And I also found a GitHub issue [godotengine/godot#4925](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/4925) about this, where `store_var` and `get_var` are suggested as a workaround.

> I agree that `File.store_var/get_var` in combination with a dictionary is already sufficient for a convenient implementation of save files. Although the analog of `allow_objects` should be added to the `VariantParser`, so that text serialization (for example, `ConfigFile`) also becomes safe.
