Tanuki's suggestions for Naoko's quest in _no signal_:

- Find the dialogue for the safe code
- Find the safe and open it
- Acquire the key
- Find the dialogue for what the key opens
- Find the dialogue for where the lockbox is hidden
- Open the lockbox

Tanuki suggested doing this by letting the player find Naoko's personal journal, but I'm reluctant to do that because it doesn't seem like something she would leave behind. I think i can reuse the same general idea though.

Right now, Spirit tells Neil that they found something in the lab that isn't on the compliance list. I could change it so they don't say where the item was found, and then I can add another dialog where someone talks about where the compliance lists are. The compliance lists then tell you where the safe is.

I'm not really sure how to add a safe code combination hint to the game. The options are:
- One of the characters says it in a chat log, which is insecure and i feel like only Bobby would do it (and he would be chastised for it too)
- One of the characters hints at what it is, by referencing shared private information. But then I'm not sure how the player would know the shared private information
- Find a note in the world with the safe code on it

I decided to have a Neil hint at the location of a note containing the safe code to Naoko.
