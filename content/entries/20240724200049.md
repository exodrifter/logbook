I'm migrating notes about note-taking from my older semi-private Obsidian vault to my newer public logbook and I noticed that I now take notes a bit differently.

Instead of keeping Journals, I have found it easier to take Zettelkasten notes whenever it feels natural to me and then link those to notes related to the projects that they are about. For example, I've been taking notes during streams and then linking those notes to the respective projects that they are about.

I no longer feel like Journals and Zettelkasten notes are very different from each other, so I'm inclined to consolidate them under the idea of taking Zettelkasten notes. For older Journal entries, it's also pretty straightforward to migrate them to the Zettelkasten format anyway. So, I'll be doing that conversion when I migrate more notes in the future instead of migrating the Journals themselves.
