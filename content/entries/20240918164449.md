Reviewed my neurofunk track _imagination_ during music lessons today.

Analysis of what I could do to improve:
- The bass is too muddy
- The track does too much scooping in the mid-range. At most, my teacher would suggest putting a -1DB scoop on the master track to help with muddiness of the mix.
- Using two basses could work well to reduce muddiness, where one does only the lower frequencies and the other only does the higher frequencies, even if the instrument is exactly the same. This makes it easier to modify either the low or upper frequency range of the sound without affecting the other. You can generally use this trick for a lot of different instruments.
- The kick could be more punchy. This could be addressed by adding a compressor on the kick.
