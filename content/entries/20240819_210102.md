no signal stream 110:
- `RayMarch` noticed the throbber inverting the color of the UI behind it which I originally attempted to fix on [2024-07-29](20240729_230310.md), and commented that it could happen if the color or alpha wasn't clamped between 0 and 1, as the behavior for values outside of that range are undefined. Sure enough, updating the throbber shader code to clamp the alpha between 0 and 1 fixed the issue.
