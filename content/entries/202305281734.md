A Journal should be used for something I would like to regularly explore and be focused on any particular topic. It should have the following qualities:

* Records information in a chronological order.
* Records what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
* Records the results of what I've done.
* Makes suggestions on what to do next, if needed.
* Be immutable; I should not modify these entries after the fact.
