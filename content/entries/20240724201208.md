I no longer agree with saying whether or not a source was used as I decided in [202306012353](202306012353.md). I've found that it's not so important whether or not I've had an original thought as it is whether or not there is a reference or related material that I should look at.

Figuring out whether or not a note is about an original thought or not is tedious and not terribly useful, and I think it's better to just link references like I currently do already.
