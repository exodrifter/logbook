After raiding [NovaLiminal](https://www.twitch.tv/novaliminal), I mentioned that the game might crash a lot on Linux due to an X11 bug. She mentioned that downgrading `libx11` to `1.8.2-1` fixed the issue for her.

Surely enough, even though I had read it before, I missed a key line in RÃ©mi's comment for [xorg/lib/libx11#199](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/issues/199#note_2393821):

> Every version since 1.8.3 seems to have exposed new random threading related crashes.

So, downgrading to a version before `1.8.3` should fix the issue. This can be done on arch linux using the [`downgrade` script](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/downgrade).
