Talking about the mixing work I did for _imagination_ in my music lesson:
- The kick is still not punchy enough, initial attack is not beefy enough but the tail is nice.
- Limiters force any excess volume to the volume you want. It only does volume control.
- Even though limiters and compressors are similar, compressors can add tone to the sound that goes over a threshold, so you might want to use both.
- Could use the same doubled low pass and high pass technique for the kick.
