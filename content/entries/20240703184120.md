Yesterday on walaber's Twitch stream, he found out that [`get_contact_local_position`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/classes/class_physicsdirectbodystate3d.html#class-physicsdirectbodystate3d-method-get-contact-local-position) is documented as returning a global position and not a local position (See: [Twitch clip](https://www.twitch.tv/walaber/clip/MistyAffluentSalamanderOSfrog-mtx4jXJfb1tyN1QR)).

As it turns out, the Godot 4.2.2 documentation is correct when it says that the function returns a global position. Additionally, this appears to be intended:

>
> The documentation clarifies this, it might be a bit confusing but it's correct, it doesn't return the "local position", it returns the position of the "local contact", as opposed to the "collider position"
>
> This can't be changed without breaking compatibility, and the rename to "global" is incorrect, as it misses the meaning
>
> Changing the return value is also breaking compatibility, and is incorrect, it should be global

> The valid rename would be to replace "local" with "body", but we can't do that without breaking compatibility
