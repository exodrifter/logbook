Ran into an issue while adding the new UI to no signal where the lines in the UI did not render nicely when scaled, as they looked jagged rather than straight. It appears that by default, textures use nearest filtering. This can be changed by going to the `Texture` foldout of the `CanvasItem` property and changing `texture_filter` to linear filtering.
