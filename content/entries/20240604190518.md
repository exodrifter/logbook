Apparently, I was incorrect in [20240530172341](20240530172341.md) when I assumed that changing the text in a rich text label does not cause lag for the Godot GUI lags on tree change issue.

For some of the corrupted UI in the game, whenever I changed the text of a `RichTextLabel` to a corrupted version on the fly a significant lag spike would happen. The solution is to have two `RichTextLabel`s with different contents and toggle the visibility instead.
