Working more on the lyrics for the song _idea_:

> imagination is cheap to you
> if only you could see this too
> you say that ideas are what you do
> if only i could see that too
>
> in the gardens you can grow
> someplace you can take it slow
> and some neighbors that say hello
> a place you don't play alone
> 
> imagination is cheap to you
> if only you could see this too
> you say that ideas are what you do
> if only i could see that too
>
> in the place i made for you
> in here you can find it too
> but you said no, i'll go alone
> i'll take my chances solo
