I was trying to figure out why some `float` values where becoming `NaN` values in the Godot debugger. However, according to the debugger the values of the variables in question were always 0 or 1 as expected.

After adding an explicit check, I found that the debugger was lying to me. Apparently, this bug in the debugger is already tracked at [godotengine/godot#88006](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/88006). This is worthy of being listed as a Godot crime
