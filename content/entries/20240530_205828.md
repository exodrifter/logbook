stream 85 of _no signal_:
- https://vods.exodrifter.space/2024/05/30/1454
- Fixed performance issues in Godot due to GUI layout (see [20240530_172341](20240530_172341.md))
- Removed the auto-generated mipmaps from the skybox to reduce build size
- Improved the copy for the network tab UI
- The new elevator chamber room is hooked it up to the game now
- Added a new tape to the storage safe -- and the game does the right thing when you try playing a tape while another tape in the inventory is already playing! Nice.
- Hid the elevator card in the storage room.

I'm almost done refactoring the demo. We'll be able to conduct playtests again soon.
