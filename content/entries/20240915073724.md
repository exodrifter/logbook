Was trying to figure out why all of the dates in my Quartz installation were set to the current date. My configuration looked like this:

```ts
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    defaultDateType: "published",
    /* elided */
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({
        priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"],
      }),
      /* elided */
    ],
    /* elided */
  },
}

export default config
```

According to the Quartz documentation:

> [Syntax, Authoring Content, Quartz Documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/authoring-content)
>
> Some common frontmatter fields that are natively supported by Quartz: [...]
> - `date`: A string representing the day the note was published. Normally uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

So, I updated my files accordingly:

```md
---
title: why i make games
date: 2024-03-18
aliases:
- why i make games
---
```

However, this did not fix the dates. Upon inspection of [the source code](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/v4/quartz/plugins/transformers/lastmod.ts), it appears that the default `CreatedModifiedDate` plugin **does not** read the `date` field to set the published date:

```ts
created ||= file.data.frontmatter.date as MaybeDate
modified ||= file.data.frontmatter.lastmod as MaybeDate
modified ||= file.data.frontmatter.updated as MaybeDate
modified ||= file.data.frontmatter["last-modified"] as MaybeDate
published ||= file.data.frontmatter.publishDate as MaybeDate
```

Changing the frontmatter to this fixed the date issue:

```md
---
title: why i make games
publishDate: 2024-03-18
aliases:
- why i make games
---
```
