Learned about the Outersloth indie game fund today, which is managed by Innersloth, the creators of _The Henry Stickmin Collection_ and _Among Us_.

They don't ask for IP rights, they don't provide help with marketing, and they don't publish the game; they more or less just provide financial assistance and they can introduce accepted applicants to other people that can help. They created the fund to see more fun, original, and clever games get made and are more likely to fund things in the $5k-2m range (assuming USD).
