A while ago, I opened a PR to address the handedness of the `is_polygon_clockwise` function which has not been merged yet ([godotengine/godot#89635](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89635)).

Originally, I opened a PR to fix the function without adding a handedness parameter, but it was rejected as it would break compatibility. In the meantime, a PR created by lawnjelly has been merged to update the documentation to be more clear about the result returned by the function ([godotengine/godot#92154](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92154)).
