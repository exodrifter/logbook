While working on _no signal_ (see [20240801_222015](20240801_222015.md)), I was trying to figure out how to determine if a face is a backface or not in a shader. Apparently, there's a built-in that you can use called `FRONT_FACING` (see [godotengine/godot#42411](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/42411#issuecomment-707740229))
