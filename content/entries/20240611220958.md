I noticed while working on _no signal_ in Godot 4.2.2 today that the scenes with corrupted text were loading much faster than usual. I think this was because I turned off the system font fallback setting.

I'm assuming this means that the system font fallback setting is very unperformant in the corrupted text case for some reason, but that would require some investigation that I don't have time for right now.
