While watching S4 E4 of Parks and Recreation, _Pawnee Rangers_, Leslie Knope is busy handing out badges to girls in the Pawnee Goddesses. That reminds me of how when I was growing up, I was interested in joining the Boy Scouts partially because I wanted to collect badges for accomplishments and feats. Historically, I also like collecting achievements for games I like too.

It occurred to me that this achievement format would work well for the hiking game I want to make as well; it would be cool to award badges to players for things related to journeying along the trail.
