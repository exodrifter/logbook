stream 87 of _no signal_:
- https://vods.exodrifter.space/2024/06/04/1403
- Add chat logs made after writing [20240603_170733](20240603_170733.md) to the game and reworked the drive item locations.
- Fixed an issue where overlapping screen shaders were not all being applied ([20240604_154022](20240604_154022.md))
- Learned about the 52 Hz whale call today, also known as "52 Blue". We should add this to the game as one of the signals.

- Fixed fuse boxes setting the colors of other fuse boxes on accident because they were duplicated from existing fuse boxes: [20240604_191544](20240604_191544.md)
- Fixed another bug related to the user being able to eject the drive when they should not be able to.
- Fixed another bug related to the Godot GUI lagging on tree change issue: [20240604_190518](20240604_190518.md)
- Unfortunately, the game still lags when the UI is initialized and added to the tree. I'm guessing this is because when we add a bunch of nodes at once at runtime, we end up indirectly calling the expensive GUI layout functions multiple times. Instead, we should save the GUI to a scene file so it can be loaded (and thus skip the layout functions) at runtime.
