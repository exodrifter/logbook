Maintenance:

- [x] You can press button before puzzle

- [ ] ~~Popups can stay open somehow?~~ Sometimes the anchor point is wrong when you select an item, not sure how to reproduce.
- [ ] ~~Cannot select pencil or scissors?~~
- [x] Cinematic is skipped if you double click?

Placement issues:
- [x] Clipboard decal is on both sides
- [x] Scissors in ceiling?

Copy changes:
- [ ] ~~Add comment about clipping~~ There doesn't seem to be a good place to add this in any of the communication dialogs.
- [x] Add a comment about elevator/comms card needing to be used on both doors

Hint System:
- [x] Don't show hint immediately
- [x] Make hint progressively smaller when used for the same hint consecutively
- [x] Make hint system work for all key items incl Access Cards

Card writer refactor:
- [x] Remove index column
- [x] Add vertical hint
- [x] Update copy accordingly
- [x] Give an explicit example of overflow, for example: "the digits in 11 are 1 and 1, so..."
