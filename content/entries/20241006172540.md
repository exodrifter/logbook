I installed the [Nix IDE plugin](https://github.com/nix-community/vscode-nix-ide) in VS Code, but while scrolling through a Nix file, I noticed that the top of the file followed me around in a small split, which I found annoying and visually messy. I couldn't find a Nix IDE plugin setting for this, but apparently it's actually a VS Code setting.

I toggled off the sticky scroll using the command palette, then searched for the setting in `Preferences: Open User Settings` to disable it permanently. I found the setting labeled as `Editor > Sticky Scroll: Enabled`, but it was already disabled. It seems that using the command palette changes the setting instead of changing it temporarily for the session, so I didn't need to do anything else.

I'm not sure why this is the first time I'm running into the issue, but I'm guessing it's because the other extensions I use don't tell the editor the information it needs to do the sticky scroll feature.
