When working on _no signal_, I noticed that some of my fuse boxes were setting the colors of other fuse boxes on accident because they were duplicated from existing fuse boxes.

This was a problem, because the fuse box prefab had some exported `NodePath`s that were meant to only be used internally, but they were exported so that the field could be set differently based on what kind of fuse box it was (some fuse boxes only need one `NodePath` while others may need three).

Since some of the fuse boxes were duplicated, the values of the exported `NodePath`s were copied in the duplicate instead of using the default value from the prefab. This was fixed by having the fuse box find the `NodePath`s itself by looking for a special path internally. In the future, I should remember to only export fields I want the user to configure when it is instantiated instead of also including fields that I want to use internally.
