I keep running into this problem with nix, where it claims that the end of the string has been reached:

```
warning: Git tree '/home/exodrifter/notes/logbook' is dirty
error (ignored): error: end of string reached
error:

```

Apparently, the important part of this error message is actually at the bottom. For some reason that I don't understand, nix flakes do not consider files that have not yet been tracked by git:

> [Nix Flakes, Part 1: An introduction and tutorial (tweag.io)](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/)

I don't know what hermetic evaluation is. Nonetheless, as you can see in this example, the file in question is not tracked yet:

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 93 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   flake.nix

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        content/entries/20240915_240936.md
        quartz.layout.ts

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If this file becomes tracked (with `git add quartz.layout.ts`, for example), then the nix error will go away.
