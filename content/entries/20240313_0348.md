While enabling all of the compiler errors, I ran into this problem with autoloads:

> [!quote] [AdriaandeJongh](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/86300)
> After making a singleton autoload as described [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html) but instead of adding the script directly you autoload a packed scene with a single node with the script attached, the editor will give a UNSAFE_METHOD_ACCESS warning (when enabled) when a method to that singleton is used.
>
> The only workaround here is to add a class_name to the singleton script and name the autoload different from the script so it can be cast:
>
> ```gdscript
> SceneManagerInstance.load_scene("level_test") # gives warning
(SceneManagerInstance as SceneManager).load_scene("level_test") # ugly workaround
> ```
>
> Expected behavior here is that the singleton is type hinted by the autoload system.
