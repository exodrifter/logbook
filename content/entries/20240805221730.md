Ran into the following error while trying to upload attachments to Gitea, which we migrated over the weekend to use Backblaze:

```
NewAttachment: Create: Unsupported header 'x-amz-checksum-algorithm' received for this API call.
```

As it turns out, according to [go-gitea/gitea#23837](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/23837), Backblaze doesn't support the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header that Gitea is sending it, and there's a configuration value to change Gitea to use the legacy `md5` behavior that backblaze expects:

> [Gitea Documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/administration/config-cheat-sheet):
> 
> `MINIO_CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM`: **default**: Minio checksum algorithm: `default` (for MinIO or AWS S3) or `md5` (for Cloudflare or Backblaze)

Setting this value should fix the error.
