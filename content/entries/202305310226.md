I'm trying to debug why avoidance doesn't seem to work with Godot's [2D navigation tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.html) example code.

The documentation in Godot for `NavigationAgent2D`'s `avoidance_enabled` property states:

> If `true` the agent is registered for an RVO avoidance callback on the `NavigationServer2D`. When `set_velocity()` is used and the processing is completed a `safe_velocity` `Vector2` is received with a signal connection to `velocity_computed`. Avoidance processing with many registered agents has a significant performance cost and should only be enabled on agents that currently require it.

`set_velocity()` reads:

> Sends the passed in velocity to the collision avoidance algorithm. It will adjust the velocity to avoid collisions. Once the adjustment to the velocity is complete, it will emit the `velocity_computed` signal.

`velocity_computed` reads:

> Notifies when the collision avoidance velocity is calculated. Emitted at the end of the physics frame in which `set_velocity()` is called. Only emitted when `avoidance_enabled` is true.

So it seems that the collision avoidance is not happening because the example navigation code sets the velocity directly without telling the navigation agent.
