I've been keeping a Journal for a while now but it has occurred to me that I've never formally recorded how and why I'm doing it the way I am.

The overall structure of a journal is as follows:

* At the top, a summary:
	* The date the journal entry was recorded as an `H1`.
	* A link to the previous entry
	* A link to the next entry
	* A summary of the rest of the journal entry
* And for each individual note in the journal:
	* The date and time the note was recorded as an `H1`
	* The note itself

In general, each individual entry is meant to be standalone; it should be comprehensible without the context of the entry before or after it. This is so that each section can be included individually in a larger note.

This is also why each individual note has an `H1` heading with the date and time in it even though it is present at the top of the document; when just the section of the journal is embedded, this makes it so that the date and time will both be visible. Otherwise, because of how Obsidian Embeds work, just the time would be visible.

Additionally, each individual note is not under an `H2` heading even though it may seem natural to nest them under the summary section because otherwise it would not be possible to embed just the summary; an Obsidian Embed will include all sub sections of the included section.
