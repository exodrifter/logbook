Just learned that `inverse` does not work if the transform has a scale or skew. Apparently, this is marked as a `FIXME` in the godot source code, and the function isn't marked as deprecated.

Instead, you should _always_ use `affine_inverse`, which does account for scale.

```
Transform3D Transform3D::inverse() const {
	// FIXME: this function assumes the basis is a rotation matrix, with no scaling.
	// Transform3D::affine_inverse can handle matrices with scaling, so GDScript should eventually use that.
	Transform3D ret = *this;
	ret.invert();
	return ret;
}
```
