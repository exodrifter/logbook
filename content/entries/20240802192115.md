- I'm running out time! 2D Con is in 21 days!
- While writing the code for resetting the camera, I realized that doing so is not going to be as trivial as I would have liked. The camera is implemented like a state machine, with states that extend `RefCounted`. Originally, I was just going to store the original state of the camera by duplicating the intial state. However, you cannot duplicate `RefCounted` instances. Furthermore, changing the states to extend `Resource` _still_ would not work, because many of the states use another class which extends `RefCounted` -- and anything that is `RefCounted` cannot be exported and won't be duplicated when the `Resource` is duplicated.

docket:
- [x] Update the credits to include new patrons and new playtesters
- [x] Limit the camera to the bounds of the level
- [x] Add a button to see all of the camera controls
- [x] Add a button to reset the camera
- [ ] Add a button to turn on the beacon circuit, so that it matches what you have to do in the reactor room
- [ ] Change thruster monitor to show data sendoff instead
