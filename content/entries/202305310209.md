Godot's [2D navigation tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.html) ended abruptly, but resulted in an example that worked. I've edited the example a little so that there are two agents going to the same destination.

One agent starts off further behind the other, but has a much faster movement speed. However, this agent gets stuck behind the slower one. I'm guessing this is because the `NavigationAgent2D` setting for avoidance is not turned on, but simply turning it on did not fix the issue. I also tried:

* Adjusting the `max_speed` property
* Adjusting the `radius` property
