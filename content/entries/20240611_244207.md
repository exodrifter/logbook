I was investigating an issue where some glyphs do not render correctly for some players in a playtest for _no signal_. I found out that by default, Godot's fonts are imported with a setting that allows the use of system fonts as a fallback turned on by default. However, not everyone's machine might have a system font that has the glyph we want to render.

I think turning this off by default is better, so we can see what is guaranteed to be displayed by the font we have selected and it also makes the game become more platform independent.

I tried using a fallback font, but I ran into an issue where the line height changed throughout my app (see [godotengine/godot#79858](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/79858)). Unfortunately, there doesn't really seem to be a nice way to get around this problem. On the bright side, I found out that `gucharmap` lets me see which glyphs are provided by the font I was using and I used that to find a suitable replacement so that I don't need to use a fallback font.
