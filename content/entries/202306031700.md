I've found myself coming across interesting talks, articles, or tools that I'd like to investigate further or write my own thoughts about. However, this often happens when I don't have the time to sit down and take a further look.

A Zettelkasten Note doesn't make much sense, because the only information I have is the link and a vague idea of why it is interesting.

For these situations, I think it would be nice to have a single note where I dump links to things that I'd like to look into later. I'm going to call this note the Inbox Note.
