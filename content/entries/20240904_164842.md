Notes about drum and bass from my music lesson:
- Reese basses are common in drum and bass. They have no decay, the pitch is sustained, and can be used as a drone. Also the progenitor of a lot of sounds in drum and bass. https://splice.com/blog/reese-bass-history/
- Reese basses are legato instruments, so the notes usually glide/slide together.
- Pairing the layering of the drums with the layering of the instruments is usually pretty satisfying.
