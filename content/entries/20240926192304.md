For the Neil and Nevaeh data, I'm not really sure how to step the progression. In both cases, you need to find some data that needs to be taken from a computer and loaded onto a probe, but I'm not seeing that many ways to give hints about that in the dialog.

Some ideas for hints include:
- Where is the computer?
- Maybe the computer has a password? Maybe it needs an access card?
- Maybe you need to press a certain sequence of buttons to get the data off the computer?

Maybe the computer doesn't have a way to write the data, but it's connected to a series of circuit sliding block puzzles that you have to complete, and there are clues as to which circuits should be working and which ones should NOT be working in order for the destination computer to write out the data. But this idea would also not involve very much dialog.

Maybe the solution is to have multiple pieces that you need to find:
- Where is the computer?
- Where is the access card to get into the room the computer is in?
- What is the code for the computer?
