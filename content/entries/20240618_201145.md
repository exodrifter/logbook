- Learned about NASA-punk
	- https://www.destructoid.com/starfields-nasa-punk-explained/
	- "NASA punk is an aesthetic that attempts to capture the feelings evoked by the American space organization, especially with regard to its early space missions. It deviates from the virtual, hologram-heavy kind of futurism that permeates pop culture and instead presents a somewhat antiquated but very sentimental vision of humans in a space-faring age."
	- "In an interview with GQ, Pely claims it’s also a very tactile aesthetic that mostly shuns holograms and touchscreens. Instead, “it’s got buttons. They’re tactile. You want to press ’em.”"
	- "The NASA punk aesthetic features lots of clunk and clutter. This is an intentional choice that helps maintain some relatability between players and humans centuries in the future. As Pely explains, regardless of how advanced humans become, “people are still people. They’re still messy.”"
