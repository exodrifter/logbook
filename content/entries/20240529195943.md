Today I worked on _no signal_.
- I decided that Instead of adding dynamic descriptions for the PGEIST modules, I would add static descriptions. Dynamic descriptions are a little harder to work with because of the localization system and I'm inclined to cut down on complexity given how behind I am compared to my original plans.
- I extracted the text corruption functions introduced for the chat log to a separate function in order to re-use, but found I could not reuse them very well because the function would throw errors or result in display issues depending on the exact input and random number generator. To avoid this issue, I changed the code to use a known set of UTF-8 characters instead of haphazardly manipulating the bits of the underlying data.
- Even though the text corruption function works better now, I decided to replace the replacement character `U+FFFE` with the shaded block character `U+1FB90` instead, as this seems to do a better job of representing the fact that the signal is static during those sections instead of corrupted.
