Investigating why some visual effects don't pause when the tree is paused. Namely, the particles generated by the `GPUParticles2D` node seem to continue moving around when paused and my shaders that use `TIME` keep animating even when paused.

For `GPUParticles2D`, this issue seems related: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/85213

And it appears that someone is working on a fix.

For my shader, it appears that the canonical solution for this is to use a global shader variable:

> **No version of this branch for 4.0 is needed, since it introduces global shader variables, with which one can easily implement their own version of this.**
