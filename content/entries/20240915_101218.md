While getting Quartz to work, I added my logo as an SVG to the site.

Quartz has a theme toggle, but since my logo is a single color it was not legible in the light theme. I tried changing the color to `currentColor`, but that didn't seem to work. Upon further investigation, I found out that there is indeed a way to get an SVG to respond to the theme of the page:

> [The best method for embedding dark-mode friendly SVG in HTML](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/svg-embed-dark-mode.html)

> ```xml
> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
>   <defs>
>     <style>
>       svg {
>         background-color: white;
>         color-scheme:light dark;
>       }
>       @media (prefers-color-scheme:dark) {
>         svg {
>           background-color: black;
>         }
>       }
>     </style>
>   </defs>
> </svg>
> ```

By changing the embedded css to use `color` instead of `background-color` and using `currentColor` instead of `#ffffff` as the color for strokes, I was able to modify the SVG accordingly so that it would respond to the current theme.
