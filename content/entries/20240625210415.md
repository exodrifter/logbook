stream 96 of _no signal_:
- Ran into a weird issue where one of my scenes did not get assigned a new UID, leading to it being replaced by the scene it was duplicating from in my scenes. I think this was because Godot ran into an error when I was duplicating the scene and moving it around.
- Learned how to focus the next UI element from code. ([20240625210532](20240625210532.md))
- Implemented the first card writing puzzle successfully! Looking forward to having it playtested on Thursday, but I'll need to tidy up the demo a little bit to make sure everything else is still working as expected.
