For the Subject Note strategy, instead of adhering consistently to having a mutable section followed by an immutable log I've found it easier to treat the note as being entirely mutable with citations to immutable notes supporting what is being said.

In some cases, the note format stays the same; which often happens for notes which are about a solution for a particular problem. In other cases, a paragraph followed by a citation which does into more detail feels more appropriate.
