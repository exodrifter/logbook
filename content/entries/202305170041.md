Streaming on Twitch. I think the first thing I should do is create a minimally working example with the camera issue just so I can test potential fixes more easily without all of the other clutter in the project.

I think I need to also check how rendering works when you start the game up the first time, so the easiest thing to do is to create a scene which changes the position when the scene is started and have a button to reload the scene. Knowing if it happens the first time or not could be useful information.
