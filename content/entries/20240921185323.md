Trying to figure out why my Discourse instance isn't working after running `./launcher rebuild app`:

```
FAILED
--------------------
Pups::ExecError: cd /var/www/discourse && sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets failed with return #<Process::Status: pid 2475 exit 1>

```

Earlier in the logs, I see:

```
I, [2024-09-21T18:46:41.038644 #1]  INFO -- : > cd /var/www/discourse && sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets
rake aborted!
Seahorse::Client::NetworkingError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 peeraddr=149.137.141.9:443 state=error: certificate verify failed (hostname mismatch) (Seahorse::Client::NetworkingError)
```

I eventually find [this thread](https://meta.discourse.org/t/ssl-connect-returned-1-errno-0-peeraddr-162-243-189-2-443-state-error-certificate-verify-failed-hostname-mismatch/269824/17), which says:

> the actual _hostname_ being connected to is `bucketname.axhjdarc4cuy.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com`, which does _not_ match `*.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com` so the error is correct.

Although the thread is not about the same exact issue I'm running into, there is an important clue here. It took me a while to realize it, but it appears that Discourse is appending the bucket name to the URL at runtime. Sure enough, if I check my config, I can see that I have the bucket name in the S3 URL already:

```yaml
DISCOURSE_S3_BUCKET: tsuki-discourse
DISCOURSE_S3_ENDPOINT: https://tsuki-discourse.s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com
```

So this means that Discourse is trying to connect to `https://tsuki-discourse.tsuki-discourse.s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com`, which is incorrect and would cause the certificate check to fail.

Changing `DISCOURSE_S3_ENDPOINT` to not have the bucket name fixes the issue:

```yaml
DISCOURSE_S3_BUCKET: tsuki-discourse
DISCOURSE_S3_ENDPOINT: https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com
```
