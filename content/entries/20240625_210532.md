I was trying to figure out how to focus the next UI element from code for Godot 4.2.2, but I couldn't find a suitable function on the `Control` class. Looking at the Godot docs, it recommends [creating an input event to send back to the game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.html):

```gdscript
var ev = InputEventAction.new()
# Set as ui_left, pressed.
ev.action = "ui_left"
ev.pressed = true
# Feedback.
Input.parse_input_event(ev)
```

I tried this by changing the action to `ui_focus_next` and it didn't work when my UI was in a `SubViewport`. I guessed that this was because the input event was being sent to the wrong `SubViewport` and found this solution:

```gdscript
var event := InputEventAction.new()
event.action = "ui_focus_next"
event.pressed = true
get_viewport().push_input(event)
```
