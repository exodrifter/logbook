I changed it to set the position in one node and then read that position in the other and got it to break. It appears that `_enter_tree` and `_ready` are not affected by `process_priority`. In fact, although `process_priority`'s documentation describes itself as changing the order in which nodes process the processing callbacks `NOTIFICATION_PROCESS`, `NOTIFICATION_PHYSICS_PROCESS`, and their internal counterparts, they really only mean `_process` and `_physics_process`. When the documentation refers to "internal counterparts", they are referring to `NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PROCESS` and `NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PHYSICS_PROCESS`. These `NOTIFICATION_*` constants are values passed to `_notification(what)`, which are used by the low-level code in the engine.

I will never need to call `_notification` unless I need to use a notification that doesn't have a corresponding function or signal.

It looks like I can get the flickering to stop by using `_enter_tree` to set the game state and `_ready` to set the position.
