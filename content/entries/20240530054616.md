I don't remember how I implemented the workaround for shaders not pausing in _no signal_. I think it would be useful to add to these notes, so here's what I had written:

```gdscript
var scaled_time: float
const HOUR: float = 60*60

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	if not get_tree().paused:
		scaled_time += delta
	while scaled_time > HOUR:
		scaled_time -= HOUR

	RenderingServer.global_shader_parameter_set("SCALED_TIME", scaled_time)
```

In order to work, a global shader parameter with the name `SCALED_TIME` needs to exist in the project settings and this code needs be added to an autoloaded singleton. In the case of _no signal_, it is part of the `GameState` autoloaded singleton.

I checked why I implemented a rollover of one hour, and it seems like I probably did it this way because [that's what's done by default for the `TIME` built-in](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/canvas_item_shader.html#global-built-ins).
