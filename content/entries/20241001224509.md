In _no signal_, I have a mechanic where the sides of a room can disappear when the player is behind them so the room can still be seen. In one of these situations in the ceiling, there was a hole which allowed the light from a `Light3D` with shadows enabled to pass through. When the ceiling was hidden, the shadows acted as if the ceiling wasn't there, which was undesirable.

I tried fixing this by changing the `VisualInstance3D` to be on a different layer that the camera couldn't see, but this didn't fix the issue. I also changed `light_cull_mask` for the `Light3D`, but this didn't work either since it appears to only control what surfaces the light ends up on.

Looking this up online, I find out that the solution is to create a `GeometryInstance3D` that has its `cast_shadow` property set to `SHADOW_CASTING_SETTING_SHADOWS_ONLY`:
