While working on _no signal_, I was looking into why the edges of a decal would sometimes disappear while viewing from certain angles in Godot 4.2.2. Looking into it, I found open issues [godot/godotengine#81889](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/81889) and [godot/godotengine#73945](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/73945) which look very similar to the problem I ran into.

For now, I've worked around the issue by simply adding additional padding to the decal texture.
