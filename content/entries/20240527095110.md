I posted about the `AnimationPlayer` shader parameter interpolation problem on t/suki and mentioned a few more details:

- The problem happens in Godot 4.2.1
- You have to set _all_ key frames in _all_ animations in order for this workaround to work. When I first tried doing this, I found that the interpolation for my animation still wouldnâ€™t work because the `RESET` animation still had a key frame with null values.
