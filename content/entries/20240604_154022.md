While working on _no signal_, ran into an issue where my screen shaders were not being combined.

I had one screen shader which does a glitch effect and another that does a blur effect, and only the blur effect was being done (presumably because it was the last screen effect in the tree).

When I was trying to figure out this issue, I found [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/s54etq/how_to_implement_multiple_screen_shaders_in_2d/) which didn't make much sense but it did mention using `CanvasLayer` to solve the problem.

Sure enough, moving the blur effect to be a child of a `CanvasLayer` fixed the problem and now both the glitch and blur effects can be used together.
