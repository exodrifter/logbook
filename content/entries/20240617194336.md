stream 91 of _no signal_:
- https://vods.exodrifter.space/2024/06/17/1856
- Fixed a few issues related to the save state not being handled properly in the game.
- Found out that Godot's JSON implementation is kind of awful (it fails the round-trip test) ([20240617214349](20240617214349.md))
- Found out while implementing my own audio transcoding solution (since Godot does not have one) that ffmpeg's console output is always sent to `stderr`. Wild!
- Attempted to compress the 92 MB skybox texture:
	- Attempted to use `ResourceSaver` compression flags, which did not really change the file size
	- Attempted to save the images as bytes into a file after using Godot's `PackedByteArray`'s `compress` function. At most, this saved a paltry 1 MB.
	- Attempted to save the images as EXR or PNG. I got a lot of undesirable results, such as the file ballooning to 769 MB and compressing to 1MB, but with all of the high dynamic range completely lost.
	- Compressing the skybox using `Image`'s compression function and then saving the images using `FileAccess`'s gzip compression worked.
