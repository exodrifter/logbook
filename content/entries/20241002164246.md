My music lesson today was about improving the mix of _imagination_:
- The kick could use more saturation
- Tube amps add distortion/saturation
- Distortion and saturation often refer to the same thing
- Add limiter to everything
- Sidechain everything else in the mix so the kick has more space
- Make the Ping sound more spacious with reverb
- On master, add stereo separation and lower mid-range frequencies
