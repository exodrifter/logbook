As it turns out, I missed this paragraph in the S3 setup instructions for Discourse:

> [meta.discourse.org](https://meta.discourse.org/t/configure-an-s3-compatible-object-storage-provider-for-uploads/148916)
>
> In order to store Discourse static assets in your Object Storage add this configuration on your app.yml under the `hooks` section:
>
>```yaml
>  after_assets_precompile:
>    - exec:
>        cd: $home
>        cmd:
>          - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets
>          - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:expire_missing_assets
> ```
>
> When using object storage, you also need a CDN to serve what gets stored in the bucket. I used StackPath CDN in my testing, and other than needing to set Dynamic Caching By Header: Accept-Encoding in their configuration it works ok.

> > `DISCOURSE_CDN_URL` is a CDN that points to you Discourse hostname and caches requests. It will be used mainly for pullable assets: CSS and other theme assets.

So apparently, first I need to set up a CDN. I decided to use [bunny.net](https://bunny.net/). The instructions for setting it up with Backblaze can be found at [support.bunny.net](https://support.bunny.net/hc/en-us/articles/360018649972-How-to-speed-up-your-Backblaze-B2-file-delivery-with-Bunny-CDN).
