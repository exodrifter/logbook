Ran into an issue in _no signal_ where Godot was loading `Vector2i` values as `String` values. As it turns out, this is because Godot's JSON implementation does not round trip correctly:

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready() -> void:
	var value: Vector2i = Vector2i(3,2)
	var string = JSON.stringify(value)
	print("String: ", string)

	var parsed = JSON.parse_string(string)
	print("Value: ", parsed)
	print("Value is String? ", parsed is String)
	print("Value is Vector2i? ", parsed is Vector2i)
```

The above code outputs:

```
String: "(3, 2)"
Value: (3, 2)
Value is String? true
Value is Vector2i? false
```

As you can see, Godot converts the `Vector2i` to a JSON string without any type information, so it can only reasonably parse the JSON string as a `String` when `parse_string` is called.

Instead, I was able to get around this issue by using `var_to_str` and `str_to_var` instead of the `JSON` API.
